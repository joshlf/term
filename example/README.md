term/example
============

This example demonstrates printing a line in each available color. Note that on non-Windows systems, LightColor is a synonym for Color (ie, LightRed and Red).

###Use

To use, remove the "_test.go" extension before building (the suffix prevents the "go get" command from installing this example directory).
