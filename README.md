This package contains functions which print text to a console in different colors. It is cross-platform compatible with most unix variants and win32 terminals (for example, windows command prompt). It is incompatible with old MS-DOS terminals.

It is based upon the work of [anschelsc](http://github.com/anschelsc) and [mewkiz](http://github.com/mewkiz). Specifically:
